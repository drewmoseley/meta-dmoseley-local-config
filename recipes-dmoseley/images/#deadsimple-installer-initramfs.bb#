# Dead simple image installer.
# This recipe builds a initramdisk based image that launches a simple
# shell for block image installation.  This can easily be loaded over
# tftp to allow network-based images to be installed without needing
# to move storage media to your development system.

DESCRIPTION = "Tiny image for installing network-accessible images onto the \
internal storage devices of embedded boards. The kernel includes \
the Minimal RAM-based Initial Root Filesystem (initramfs), which finds the \
first 'init' program more efficiently."
